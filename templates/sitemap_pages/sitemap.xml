Sitemap index files can't contain other index files â€“ each sitemap 
index can contain links to regular sitemaps. Multiple sitemap indexes 
can be submitted to Google individually, though.

Each individual sitemap index can include up to 1,000 references 
to another <sitemap>. If you need to reference more than that, 
   create multiple sitemap indexes and submit each one.

Each individual sitemap can include up to 50,000 page references. 
If you need more than that, split them across multiple sitemaps.
